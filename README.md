# Yavuz-Akpinar-Bitirme-Projesi

<p>In this app my aim was the create a running app. Users can register and log in  with their e-mail adress.With the register process app will create a database for that e-mail address
at firebase-firestore.After logged in users can see their profile page along with their past running info. Users can go other pages like activity history, new activity, leaderbord
with buttons from profile page or using drawer.At new activity page users can start a new run activity and they can see their location and route at the map along with
their total run distance, timer, avarage speed, a bar chart which is showing their distance per minute and some weather data.With the finish button they can
stop and share their running infos at social media.At activity history page users have access their past runs and they can go for the details for any past run.At leaderbord
page users can see top 50 distance runner with their run distance and username.
